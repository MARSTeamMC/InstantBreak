	"description": "In Minecraft, you can instantly break stone, but not wood, glass, or deepslate. InstantBreak fixes that. It allows instant breaking of most blocks.\nThis mod changes Minecraftâ€™s break calculation for strong, like netherite or gold, tools to instamine easier. For example, you only need a netherite axe with efficiency V to instantly break wood. It also expands which tools are considered valid for certain blocks. For example, pickaxes can now break glass, and axes can break skulls.",
